Touchscreen for Streaming on a prayer

The attached code is for the project 'streaming on a prayer'. (currently code for wifi is commented out as it will only run on linux). 

Completed tasks:
 - Set up frames for settings, streaming, main menu and guide with their widgets (Matthew)
 - Add in mechanism for saving and loading user preferences when inputting stream code (Matthew)
 - Added in Keyboard (Matthew)
 - Added in module that imposed a theme to improve UI layout (Sita) 
 - Edited widgits to fit new layouts: arrow buttons, removed main menu, and stopped text extending off screen (Matthew). 
 
 Tasks currently in progress
 - Add in mechanism for user to connect to Wifi through touchscreen (Matthew)
       - Done for WEP (need to test)
       - Need to do for WPA and WPA2 (possibly through editing config file, or finding module)

Tasks still to complete/would be nice to do: (please tick these off as appropriate)
 - Add in a slider to dim screen (or have a function to make touchscreen 'sleep' to save battery a few minutes after streaming begins (I think Abigail said she'd look into this)
 - Type in a guide for the user (Matthew/Sam)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- YOU WILL NEED TO DOWNLOAD PHOTOS AND CHANGE THEIR DIRECTORIES FOR CODE TO RUN
- Switch between 0,1 at the start of the code where it says screen size to change between the smaller display we're planning to use and my (Matthew) touchscreen size. 
- There is currently a photo  where the stream will go (because I don't have a stream from the camera at the moment)
